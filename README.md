A Multiplatform Stock Market Analysis Platform!

## Story and Concept 🖋
The Stockinator project began as a result of a Project Mgmt class - initially designed to be a desktop application to function as a stock screening tool, it has now expanded to possibly implement a web app with the same purpose.

## What is a Stock Screener? 🔎
A stock screener is a tool designed to screen for stocks using any parameters you wish to define. It allows decision-making using data. Even if you don't know much about stocks, it should be easy to understand why it's so useful to use them.

## Project Details 📕
Stockinator is currently working using a Electron/React frontend that pulls data from a simple backend designed using Python/FastAPI and that is currently hosted in [Heroku](https://stockinator-data.herokuapp.com/stock/MSFT). The choice for a JavaScript framework was to allow easy migration for both mobile and web environments.

## Open-source Programs 👾
Winter of Code is an open-source program envisioned by DevScript that helps understand the paradigm of Open Source contribution. It aims to bring students into the world of open source development and see the power of unified problem solving in real time.
